      "content='Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). It involves the use of artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence \"deep\") to model and understand complex patterns in data. Here are some key aspects of deep learning:\\n\\n1. **Neural Networks**: At the core of deep learning are neural networks, which are inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (\"neurons\") that process input data, learn from it, and make predictions or decisions.\\n\\n2. **Layers**: Deep learning models typically have many layers, hence the term \"deep\". These layers can extract increasingly abstract features from the data. The first layer might learn simple features like edges in images, while deeper layers might learn more complex structures like shapes or even entire objects.\\n\\n3. **Training**: Deep learning models are trained using large datasets. Through a process called backpropagation and optimization algorithms like gradient descent, the model learns to minimize the error in its predictions by adjusting the weights of connections between neurons.\\n\\n4. **Applications**: Deep learning has been highly successful in various domains, particularly those involving large amounts of unstructured data. It is used in image and speech recognition, natural language processing, autonomous driving, game playing, and much more.\\n\\n5. **Popular Architectures**: There are several well-known neural network architectures used in deep learning, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image data, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence data, and Transformers for handling complex tasks in natural language processing.\\n\\n6. **Tools and Frameworks**: There are various tools and libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe, and Keras that facilitate building and training deep learning models.\\n\\nDeep learning\\'s effectiveness stems largely from its ability to automatically feature engineer and identify patterns without explicit programming, which is particularly useful in fields with complex datasets. However, it often requires significant computational resources and large datasets to perform well.' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 404, 'prompt_tokens': 14, 'total_tokens': 418, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_3347cb7a33', 'id': 'chatcmpl-DBOyugyG9xDcGD4hNEPV8g0WH68ZY', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019c7c2e-f054-7043-b85c-ed429764517c-0' tool_calls=[] invalid_tool_calls=[] usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 14, 'output_tokens': 404, 'total_tokens': 418, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}\n"

      "content=\"India is a diverse and vibrant country located in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by land area and the second-most populous country in the world, with over 1.4 billion people as of 2023. Here are some key aspects of India:\\n\\n1. **Geography**: India shares borders with Pakistan, China, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. It also has a vast coastline along the Indian Ocean, with the Arabian Sea to the west and the Bay of Bengal to the east.\\n\\n2. **History**: India has a rich history that dates back thousands of years. It is known as the birthplace of several major religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. India became independent from British colonial rule in 1947 and is now a sovereign, democratic republic.\\n\\n3. **Government and Politics**: India is a federal parliamentary democratic republic. It has a President as the head of state and a Prime Minister as the head of government. The Indian Parliament consists of two houses: the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States).\\n\\n4. **Economy**: India has a mixed economy characterized by agriculture, manufacturing, and services. It is one of the world's fastest-growing major economies, driven by sectors like information technology, telecommunications, textiles, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.\\n\\n5. **Culture**: India's culture is marked by its diversity in languages, traditions, and customs. It recognizes 22 official languages, with Hindi and English being widely spoken. Indian culture is famous for its classical music, dance, art, and film industry (Bollywood).\\n\\n6. **Cuisine**: Indian cuisine is known for its use of a wide variety of spices and flavors. Popular dishes include curries, biryanis, samosas, dosas, and a wide range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes.\\n\\n7. **Wildlife and Biodiversity**: India is home to a wide range of wildlife and diverse ecosystems. It houses several national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, including the Sundarbans, Gir Forest, and Jim Corbett National Park, which protect species like tigers, elephants, and rhinos.\\n\\n8. **Education and Science**: India has made significant strides in education and technology.
